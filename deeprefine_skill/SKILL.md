# DeepRefine — Agent Reafiner loop (strict)

You **MUST** implement the **same control flow** as `Reafiner.refine()` in DeepRefine (`autorefiner/src/reafiner.py`).

| Component | Agent mode | CLI `deeprefine refine` |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------|
| Retrieval | `graphify query` + k-hop from `graph.json` | FAISS retriever |
| LLM | **Your session model** | External API / vLLM |
| Graph writes | `deeprefine apply` + validated `loop_trace_*.json` | In-process |

---

## FORBIDDEN (hard stop)

Do **NOT**:

1. Run `deeprefine refine` (unless the user explicitly asks for CLI/FAISS mode).
2. Call `deeprefine apply` without a valid `loop_trace_<query_id>.json` (CLI will reject).
3. Skip any hop’s `<judge>Yes</judge>` / `<judge>No</judge>` judgement.
4. Skip error abduction when `len(interaction_history) > 1`.
5. Write `<refinement>` before abduction when refinement is required.
6. Hand-edit `graph.json` with Python or ad-hoc JSON patches.
7. Run `deeprefine history add` at the start of `/deeprefine` (only `loop finish` updates history).
8. Invent a shorter pipeline (“read file → write refinement → apply”).

If validation fails, **fix the trace and re-run the missing step** — do not bypass with `--skip-trace-check`.

## Constants (match `refine_runner.py` / Reafiner)

```text
MAX_HOPS = 4
INCREMENT_HOP = 1
BASE_TOP_K = 10
MAX_TRIPLE_NUM_BY_STEP = [5, 10, 15, 20]   # cap triples per step
HISTORY_HORIZON = 4                        # abduction uses last N steps
```

---

## Mandatory artifact

For each query, maintain:

`graphify-out/.deeprefine/loop_trace_<query_id>.json`

Create template:

```bash
deeprefine loop init --query "<exact question>"
```

Append each hop to `interaction_history` **before** starting the next hop.  
Run `deeprefine loop validate --trace-file ...` after abduction and before `apply`.

---

## Control flow (must match `Reafiner.refine()`)

Pseudocode — follow **exactly**:

```text
interaction_history = []
for step in 1..MAX_HOPS:
    print "[Step: {step}]"   # show in chat

    if step == 1:
        # Vector-retrieval equivalent: graphify query on full question
        RUN: graphify query "<question>"
        triples = parse NODE/EDGE → [{subject, relation, object}, ...]
        cap = MAX_TRIPLE_NUM_BY_STEP[0]  # 5
        record retrieval.method = "graphify_query"
    else:
        # k-hop expansion from entities in previous hop (NOT a new random search)
        entities = unique subjects/objects from previous triples
        expand 1-hop neighbors from graphify-out/graph.json (or graphify query on entities)
        cap = MAX_TRIPLE_NUM_BY_STEP[step-1]
        record retrieval.method = "k_hop_expansion" or "graphify_query+k_hop_expansion"

    triples = dedupe; len(triples) <= cap

    # Answerable judgement — session LLM, prompts below
    answerable, judgement_raw = LLM_judge(question, triples)
    MUST output ONLY: <judge>Yes</judge> or <judge>No</judge>

    append interaction_history with:
      step, query, num_hops=(step-1)*INCREMENT_HOP, base_top_k=10,
      retrieved_subgraph, answerable, judgement_raw,
      retrieval: {method, evidence: "<command output excerpt>"}

    if answerable:
        BREAK   # stop hop loop

# --- same branch as Reafiner.refine() line 314+ ---
if len(interaction_history) <= 1:
    # Early exit: first hop was answerable — NO graph refinement
    set trace.early_exit = true
    deeprefine loop finish --trace-file ...   # no --refinement-file
    STOP
else:
    # len > 1 → ALWAYS error abduction + actions (even if last hop was Yes)
    error_abduction = LLM_abduction(interaction_history[-HISTORY_HORIZON:])
    MUST output: <abduction>...</abduction>

    actions = LLM_kg_refinement(
        last_hop.retrieved_subgraph,
        error_abduction,
        question,
        source file hints from triples,
    )
    MUST output: <refinement>insert_edge(...)|...</refinement>

    save refinement to graphify-out/.deeprefine/refinement_actions_<id>.txt
    deeprefine loop validate --trace-file ... --refinement-file ...
    deeprefine apply --trace-file ... --refinement-file ...
    deeprefine loop finish --trace-file ... --refinement-file ...
```

**Critical Reafiner rule:** refinement runs when `len(interaction_history) > 1`, not only when all judgements are `No`.

## LLM prompts (verbatim — do not paraphrase)

### Judgement (`_answerable_judgement`)

**System:**

```text
As an advanced judgement assistant, your task is to judge whether the given question is answerable based on the provided KG context.

Evaluate whether the given question is answerable based on the provided KG context. Output your judgment in the following format:
<judge>Yes</judge> or <judge>No</judge>

**Important:** You must think carefully about the question and the KG context before making your judgment. And output your judgment result directly in the specified format.
```

**User:**

```text
Question: {question}
Knowledge Graph (KG) context: {triples_string}
```

`{triples_string}` = one triple per line: `subject | relation | object`

### Error abduction (`_error_abduction`) — only if `len(interaction_history) > 1`

**System:**

```text
As an advanced error abduction assistant, your task is to analyze the error reasons based on the given interaction history.

Analyze the reasons of the unanswerable questions based on the given interaction history from the incompleteness, incorrectness, and redundancy perspectives. Output your analysis in the following format:
<abduction>...</abduction>

**Important:** You must think carefully about the interaction history before making your analysis. And output your analysis result directly in the specified format.
```

**User:**

```text
Interaction history: {interaction_history}
```

`{interaction_history}` format (same as Reafiner):

```text
Step1:
['Query': ..., 'Subgraph_hop': ..., 'Subgraph_content': ..., 'Answerable': ...]

Step2:
...
```

### KG refinement actions (`_kg_refinement_action`) — only if `len(interaction_history) > 1`

**System:**

```text
As an advanced knowledge graph refinement assistant, your task is to generate a series of actions (**within 10 actions**) to refine the given KG to make it more suitable for answering the given question.

Based on the given KG and the analysed error reasons, refine the given KG to make it more easily for retrieval and answering the given question. You have the following three types of actions to conduct:

- insert_edge(subject, relation, object): Insert a new edge into the KG to complete the missing information.
- delete_edge(subject, relation, object): Delete an edge from the KG to remove the redundant information or conflicting information.
- replace_node(old_entity, new_entity): Replace an entity in the KG to correct the errors or deal with disambiguation.

Output a series of actions (**within 10 actions**) in the following format:
<refinement>insert_edge("...", "...", "...")|delete_edge("...", "...", "...")|replace_node("...", "...")|...</refinement>

**Important:** You must think carefully about the given KG and the analysed error reasons before making your refinement. DO NOT DELETE ANY IRRELEVANT TRIPLES FROM THE ORIGINAL KG. TRY TO KEEP THE ORIGINAL KG AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT GENERATE TOO MANY ACTIONS. And output your refinement result directly in the specified format.
```

**User:**

```text
Original Text: {original_text}
KG: {triples_string}
Question: {question}
Error reasons: {error_reasons}
```

Use **last hop’s** `retrieved_subgraph` as `{triples_string}` (JSON list is OK in trace; string form for the prompt).

## Per-query checklist (report in chat)

Copy and tick each item in your final message:

```text
[ ] Backup: graphify-out/.deeprefine/graph.json.bak
[ ] loop_trace_<id>.json created
[ ] Step 1: graphify query executed (evidence in trace)
[ ] Each step: <judge>Yes|No</judge> shown in chat
[ ] Hops stopped on Yes OR reached MAX_HOPS
[ ] early_exit OR (abduction + refinement) per Reafiner branch
[ ] deeprefine loop validate passed
[ ] deeprefine apply (only if refinement path)
[ ] deeprefine loop finish
```

## Commands (in order)

```bash
# 0. KB project root; graphify-out/graph.json exists
mkdir -p graphify-out/.deeprefine
cp graphify-out/graph.json graphify-out/.deeprefine/graph.json.bak
deeprefine loop init --query "<question>"

# 1–4. For each hop: graphify/graph read → judge → append to loop_trace_*.json

# 5a. Early exit (len(history)==1 and answerable)
deeprefine loop validate --trace-file graphify-out/.deeprefine/loop_trace_<id>.json
deeprefine loop finish --trace-file graphify-out/.deeprefine/loop_trace_<id>.json
